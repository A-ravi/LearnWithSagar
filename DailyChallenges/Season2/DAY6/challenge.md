Challenge Overview
Theory: Explain the key differences between GitHub and GitLab, the migration process, and the importance of migrating all objects.

Subtasks:

Migrate repositories and their content.

Migrate users, permissions, and teams.

Migrate issues, pull requests, and projects.

Migrate GitHub Actions workflows to GitLab CI/CD.

Migrate repository settings, webhooks, and integrations.

Process: Provide a step-by-step guide for the candidate to follow.

Evaluation: Assess the candidate's understanding, execution, and problem-solving skills.

Detailed Steps and Plan
1. Theory (Knowledge Assessment)
Ask the candidate to answer the following questions:

What are the key differences between GitHub and GitLab?

What are the challenges of migrating all GitHub objects (repositories, users, workflows, etc.) to GitLab?

How would you ensure data integrity during the migration?

What are the best practices for migrating CI/CD pipelines and workflows?

2. Subtasks
Subtask 1: Migrate Repositories and Content
The candidate should:

Use GitLab's built-in GitHub importer (recommended in the GitLab blog) to migrate repositories.

Ensure all branches, tags, and commit history are preserved.

Verify that the repository content (code, files, etc.) is intact.

Subtask 2: Migrate Users, Permissions, and Teams
The candidate should:

Create corresponding users in GitLab.

Map GitHub users to GitLab users.

Migrate teams and permissions (e.g., admin, maintainer, developer) using GitLab groups and access controls.

Subtask 3: Migrate Issues, Pull Requests, and Projects
The candidate should:

Use GitLab's import tools or third-party tools (e.g., github-gitlab-importer) to migrate issues, pull requests, and projects.

Ensure all metadata (e.g., labels, milestones, comments) is preserved.

Subtask 4: Migrate GitHub Actions Workflows to GitLab CI/CD
The candidate should:

Convert GitHub Actions workflows (.github/workflows/*.yml) to GitLab CI/CD pipelines (.gitlab-ci.yml).

Replicate all steps (e.g., build, test, deploy) in GitLab CI/CD.

Use GitLab CI/CD features like caching, artifacts, and environments to optimize the pipeline.

Subtask 5: Migrate Repository Settings and Webhooks
The candidate should:

Migrate repository settings (e.g., branch protection rules, merge request settings).

Recreate webhooks in GitLab for integrations (e.g., Slack, Jira).

3. Process
Provide the candidate with the following step-by-step instructions:

Prepare for Migration:

Audit the GitHub organization to identify all objects to be migrated (repositories, users, projects, workflows, etc.).

Create a GitLab group or namespace to mirror the GitHub organization structure.

Migrate Repositories:

Use GitLab's GitHub importer (as described in the GitLab blog) to migrate repositories.

Verify that all branches, tags, and commit history are preserved.

Migrate Users, Permissions, and Teams:

Create users in GitLab and map them to GitHub users.

Assign appropriate roles and permissions in GitLab using groups and access controls.

Migrate Issues, Pull Requests, and Projects:

Use GitLab's import tools or third-party tools to migrate issues, pull requests, and projects.

Verify that all metadata (labels, milestones, comments) is preserved.

Migrate GitHub Actions Workflows:

Convert GitHub Actions workflows to GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

Test the pipelines to ensure they work as expected.

Migrate Repository Settings and Webhooks:

Recreate repository settings (e.g., branch protection rules) in GitLab.

Recreate webhooks for integrations.

Validate the Migration:

Run the GitLab CI/CD pipelines and verify that all steps pass.

Deploy the application (if applicable) and ensure it works as expected.

Verify that all issues, pull requests, and projects are intact.

Document the Process:

Write a detailed report explaining the migration steps, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

4. Evaluation Criteria
Evaluate the candidate based on the following:

Knowledge: Understanding of GitHub, GitLab, and migration concepts.

Execution: Ability to migrate all objects and ensure data integrity.

Problem-Solving: Handling errors and optimizing the migration process.

Documentation: Clarity and completeness of the migration report.

Tools and Resources
GitHub Organization: Provide access to a sample GitHub organization with repositories, users, projects, and workflows.

GitLab Group: Provide access to a GitLab group for migration.

Documentation:

GitLab's GitHub Importer

GitLab CI/CD Documentation

Third-Party Migration Tools

Timeline
Preparation: 1 hour (audit GitHub organization and plan migration).

Migration: 4 hours (migrate repositories, users, projects, workflows, etc.).

Validation and Documentation: 2 hours.

Bonus Tasks (Optional)
Migrate GitHub Wikis and Pages to GitLab.

Implement advanced GitLab CI/CD features (e.g., environments, artifacts).

Set up monitoring and alerting for the migrated pipelines.

This challenge will test the candidate's ability to perform a complete migration while ensuring data integrity, minimal downtime, and adherence to best practices. It also provides insight into their problem-solving and documentation skills. The referenced guides will serve as excellent resources for the candidate to follow during the challenge.
